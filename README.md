# qft-qiskit
The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is an integral transform that is responsible for the speedup in many quantum algorithms.

Implemented using Qiskit, this code contains a breakdown of the QFT and the necessary tools to see its action, such as plotting a circuit, histogram, and Bloch's sphere.
